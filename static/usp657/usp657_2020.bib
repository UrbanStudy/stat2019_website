  abstract = {Problem: Localities and states are turning to land planning and urban design for help in reducing automobile use and related social and environmental costs. The effects of such strategies on travel demand have not been generalized in recent years from the multitude of available studies. Purpose: We conducted a meta-analysis of the built environment-travel literature existing at the end of 2009 in order to draw generalizable conclusions for practice. We aimed to quantify effect sizes, update earlier work, include additional outcome measures, and address the methodological issue of self-selection. Methods: We computed elasticities for individual studies and pooled them to produce weighted averages. Results and conclusions: Travel variables are generally inelastic with respect to change in measures of the built environment. Of the environmental variables considered here, none has a weighted average travel elasticity of absolute magnitude greater than 0.39, and most are much less. Still, the combined effect of several such variables on travel could be quite large. Consistent with prior work, we find that vehicle miles traveled (VMT) is most strongly related to measures of accessibility to destinations and secondarily to street network design variables. Walking is most strongly related to measures of land use diversity, intersection density, and the number of destinations within walking distance. Bus and train use are equally related to proximity to transit and street network design variables, with land use diversity a secondary factor. Surprisingly, we find population and job densities to be only weakly associated with travel behavior once these other variables are controlled. Takeaway for practice: The elasticities we derived in this meta-analysis may be used to adjust outputs of travel or activity models that are otherwise insensitive to variation in the built environment, or be used in sketch planning applications ranging from climate action plans to health impact assessments. However, because sample sizes are small, and very few studies control for residential preferences and attitudes, we cannot say that planners should generalize broadly from our results. While these elasticities are as accurate as currently possible, they should be understood to contain unknown error and have unknown confidence intervals. They provide a base, and as more built-environment/travel studies appear in the planning literature, these elasticities should be updated and refined.

In contrast, the Poisson model implies a positive-sum economy, in which one region{\textquoteright}s gain is no other region{\textquoteright}s loss. We also show that all intermediate cases can be represented as a nested logit model with a single outside option. The nested logit turns out to be a linear combination of the conditional logit and Poisson models.

Under mild regularity conditions, any discrete choice model derived from random utility maximization has choice probabilities that can be approximated as closely as one pleases by a MMNL model. Practical estimation of a parametric mixing family can be carried out by Maximum Simulated Likelihood Estimation or Method of Simulated Moments, and easily computed instruments are provided that make the latter procedure fairly efficient. The adequacy of a mixing specification can be tested simply as an omitted variable test with appropriately defined artificial variables. An application to a problem of demand for alternative vehicles shows that MMNL provides a flexible and computationally practical approach to discrete response analysis.

The analysis is based on the premise that the classical, economically rational consumer will choose a residential location by weighing the attributes of each available alternative and by selecting the alternative that maximizes utility. The assumption of independence in the commonly used multinomial logit model of choice is relaxed to permit a structure of perceived similarities among alternatives. In this analysis, choice is described by a multinomial logit model for aggregates of similar alternatives. Also discussed are methods for controlling the size of data collection and estimation tasks by sampling alternatives from the full set of alternatives.},

The methods of discrete choice analysis and their applications in the modelling of transportation systems constitute a comparatively new field that has largely evolved over the past 15 years. Since its inception, however, the field has developed rapidly, and this is the first text and reference work to cover the material systematically, bringing together the scattered and often inaccessible results for graduate students and professionals.

The introductory chapter presents the background of discrete choice analysis and context of transportation demand forecasting. Subsequent chapters cover, among other topics, the theories of individual choice behavior, binary and multinomial choice models, aggregate forecasting techniques, estimation methods, tests used in the process of model development, sampling theory, the nested-logit model, and systems of models.

Simulation-assisted estimation procedures are investigated and compared, including maximum simulated likelihood, method of simulated moments, and method of simulated scores.  Procedures for drawing from densities are described, including variance reduction techniques such as anithetics and Halton draws. Recent advances in Bayesian procedures are explored, including the use of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and its variant Gibbs sampling.

	abstract = {A vast literature in statistics, biometrics, and econometrics is concerned with the analysis of binary and polychotomous response data. The classical approach fits a categorical response regression model using maximum likelihood, and inferences about the model are based on the associated asymptotic theory. The accuracy of classical confidence statements is questionable for small sample sizes. In this article, exact Bayesian methods for modeling categorical response data are developed using the idea of data augmentation. The general approach can be summarized as follows. The probit regression model for binary outcomes is seen to have an underlying normal regression structure on latent continuous data. Values of the latent data can be simulated from suitable truncated normal distributions. If the latent data are known, then the posterior distribution of the parameters can be computed using standard results for normal linear models. Draws from this posterior are used to sample new latent data, and the process is iterated with Gibbs sampling. This data augmentation approach provides a general framework for analyzing binary regression models. It leads to the same simplification achieved earlier for censored regression models. Under the proposed framework, the class of probit regression models can be enlarged by using mixtures of normal distributions to model the latent data. In this normal mixture class, one can investigate the sensitivity of the parameter estimates to the choice of {\textquotedblleft}link function,{\textquotedblright} which relates the linear regression estimate to the fitted probabilities. In addition, this approach allows one to easily fit Bayesian hierarchical models. One specific model considered here reflects the belief that the vector of regression coefficients lies on a smaller dimension linear subspace. The methods can also be generalized to multinomial response models with J {\textgreater} 2 categories. In the ordered multinomial model, the J categories are ordered and a model is written linking the cumulative response probabilities with the linear regression structure. In the unordered multinomial model, the latent variables have a multivariate normal distribution with unknown variance-covariance matrix. For both multinomial models, the data augmentation method combined with Gibbs sampling is outlined. This approach is especially attractive for the multivariate probit model, where calculating the likelihood can be difficult.},

The book begins with fundamental notions such as probability, exchangeability and Bayes' rule, and ends with modern topics such as variable selection in regression, generalized linear mixed effects models, and semiparametric copula estimation. Numerous examples from the social, biological and physical sciences show how to implement these methodologies in practice.

Examining the spatial characteristics of daily household activity-travel behavior holds important implications for understanding and addressing urban transportation issues. Research of this sort can inform development of urban land use policy that encourages the use of local opportunities, potentially leading to reduced motorized travel. This article examines the potential household activity-travel response to a planned metropolitan polycentric hierarchy of activity centers. Behavioral observations have been drawn from an activity-travel survey conducted in the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area during the mid-1990s. Evidence presented from exploratory analysis indicates an urban/suburban differential, with less daily travel and smaller activity spaces for urban households. Investigation of the travel reduction potential of the proposed land-use strategy suggests that location effects could be offset by adjustments to household sociodemographic and mobility characteristics.},
