### A1 Suppose X and Y have the joint pdf

f(x; y) =Cxy if 0  x  2; 0  y  2; and x + y  2

0 otherwise

(a) (4 pts) Find the value of C;

(b) (4 pts) Find the marginal densities of X and Y and check whether they are independent or not;

(c) (2 pts) Compute P(X < Y );

### A2 (10 pts) Suppose Y1 and Y2 are i.i.d. random variables and the p.d.f. of each of them is as follows:

f(y) =ey if y  0,
0; otherwise.

with  > 0.

Find the p.d.f. of X = Y1 Y2.

### A3 Let  be Beta distributed,   Beta(1; 1). Let N1 be Binomial given , that is N1  Bin(n; ) given .

(a) (4 pts) Compute p(jN1 = n1) and E[jN1 = n1]

(b) (6 pts) Compute P(N1 = n1) for n1 = 0...n.

### A4 Let X1; : : : ;X10 be a random sample from a Poisson distribution with mean .

(a) (4 Ppts) Use the method of moment generating functions to nd the distribution of S10 = 10i=1 Xi.

(b) (6 pts) Let S4 =P4 i=1 Xi Find the conditional distribution of S4 given S10 = s, for
s > 0. This distribution belongs to a family of distributions that you know. Which family? which parameters?

### B1 (10 pts) Let X1; : : : ;Xn be a random sample from a normal distribution N(; 2 = 25). Reject H0 :  = 50 and accept H1 :  = 55 if Xn  c. Find the two equations in n and c that you
would solve to get P( X n  c j ) = K() to be equal to K(50) = 0:05 and K(55) = 0:90.

Solve these two equations. Round up if n is not an integer. Hint: z:05 = 1:645 and z:1 = 1:28
