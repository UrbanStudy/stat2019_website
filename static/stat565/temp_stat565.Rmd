### Problem 1 

In a greenhouse experiment, 5 types of light were used: natural, white, green, blue, and yellow. Eight tobacco plants, each 10 mm tall, were subjected to each type of light with the following means and variances of stem growths (in mm).

|  Color | Natural | White | Yellow | Blue | Green |
|   ---- |    ---  |  ---  |  ----  | ---- | ----  |
|  Mean  | 4.09    |4.30   |3.55    |3.01  |3.19   |
|Variance| 0.027   |0.083  |0.066   |0.030 |0.073  |

A partial ANOVA table was found to be

|Source of Variance|Sum of Squares (SS)|Degrees of Freedom (df)|Mean Squares (MS)|F test statistic $F_0$|
| ---  | ---  | --- | --- | --- |
|Treatment(Between or Model)|9.95904|4 | | |
|Error(Within)              |1.950  |35| |   
|Total                      |       |39|

  (a) Complete the ANOVA table assuming the one-way fixed effects ANOVA model. Show main steps of your work. Keep 3 decimal places in $SS_{Trt}$

For $a=5,n=8$, $SS_T=N-1=5\times8-1=39$, $SS_{Trt}=5-1=4$, $SS_E=N-a=35$

$$\bar y_{..}=\frac{1}a\sum^a_{i=1}\bar y_{i.}=\frac{1}5(4.09+4.30+3.55+3.01+3.19)=3.628$$

$$SS_{Trt}=n\sum^a_{i=1}(\bar y_{i.}−\bar y_{..})^2=9.95904$$

$$MS_{Trt}=\frac{SS_{Trt}}{a-1}=\frac{9.95904}4=2.48976$$
$$MS_{E}=\frac{SS_{E}}{N-a}=\frac{1.950}{35}=0.05571429$$

$$F_{0}=\frac{MS_{Trt}}{MS_{E}}=\frac{2.48976}{0.05571429}=44.688$$

```{r}
bar_y_all <- (4.09+4.30+3.55+3.01+3.19)/5
bar_y_all
ss_trt <- 8*((4.09-bar_y_all)^2+(4.30-bar_y_all)^2+(3.55-bar_y_all)^2+(3.01-bar_y_all)^2+(3.19-bar_y_all)^2)
ss_trt
(ss_trt/4)/(1.950/35)
```

  (b) Compute the standard error of the difference of two observed treatment means. (that is, compute $e(\bar y _{i.}-\bar y_{j.})$) Show main steps of your work.

$$e(\bar y _{i.}-\bar y_{j.})=\sqrt{\frac{2MSE}n}=\sqrt{\frac{2\times0.05571429}8}=0.1180194$$

```{r}

sqrt(2*1.950/{8*35})

```

### Problem 2 (3.37/45)

Exercise 3.37. Assume n_i is the number of observations (replications) for the $i^th$ treatment in the one-way ANVOA. Show main steps of work.

Show that the variance of the linear combination $\sum^{a}_{i=1}c_iy_{i.}$ is $σ^2\sum^{a}_{i=1}n_ic_i^2$

This is an unbalanced CRD. For $c_i$ is contrast constants,

$$Var\left[\sum^{a}_{i=1}c_iy_{i.}\right]=\sum^{a}_{i=1}\left[c_i^2Var(\sum^{n_i}_{j=1}y_{ij})\right]=\sum^{a}_{i=1}\left[c_i^2Var(\sum^{n_i}_{i=1}(\mu_i+ε_{ij}))\right]=\sum^{a}_{i=1}\left[c_i^2Var(n_i\mu_i+\sum^{n_i}_{j=1}ε_{ij})\right]$$

By the assumption for linear combination, $\mu_i$ is a constant. $Var(n_i\mu_i)=0$ and $Var(ε_{ij})=\sigma^2$, then the fomula equals

$$=\sum^{a}_{i=1}\left[c_i^2(0+\sum^{n_i}_{j=1}Var(ε_{ij}))\right]=\sum^{a}_{i=1}\left[c_i^2n_i\sigma^2\right]=σ^2\sum^{a}_{i=1}n_ic_i^2$$

$Var(\mu_i+ε_{ij})=Var(\mu_i)+Var(ε_{ij})$


By the assumption of contrast constants, $\sum^{a}_{i=1}c_i=0$

### Problem 3

Let  y_ij=μ+τ_i+ε_ij,   ε_ij  ~ iid N(0,σ^2 )  ,for i=1,2,…,a ; for j=1,2,…,n ; ∑_(i=1)^aτ_i =0
y (i.)=1/n ∑_(i = 1)^ny_ij    ,y_(i.)   ~ iid N(μ+τ_i  ,   σ^2/n)

$y_i=β_0+β_1 x_i+ε$, $E(ε_i)=0$, $Var(ε_i)=\sigma^2$, for $i=1,2,…,n$; $Cov(ε_i,ε_j)=0$ for $i≠j$, $x_i=\begin{cases}0& \text{for Male for }i=1,2,…,\frac{n}2\\1& \text{for Female for}\frac{n}2+1,\frac{n}2+2,..n\end{cases}$
  (a) Using ONLY the above given information and properties of expected value of a function of random variables, derive (DO NOT use any other distribution properties)

E(y_ij-y (i.)  )=
Var(y_ij-y (i.)  )=

  (b) Using your answers in part (a) and shortcut formula for variance ( Var(X)=E(X^2 )-E(X)^2), find 
E[(y_ij-y (i.) )^2 ]=

  (c) Let a=3 treatments in the above model and the following linear functions of μ_i=μ+τ_i are tested.
μ_1=μ_2   ,   (μ_1+μ_2)/2=μ_3
    (i) Prove that each of these is a contrast.
    (ii) Write Sum of Squares for each contrast (SS_c) in terms of y (1.)  ,y (2.)  ,y (3.) .
    (iii) Add the two SS_c you found in part (ii) and simplify (expand and bring similar terms together).

Then expand and simplify the SS_Trt given below to prove that it is equivalent to the sum of two SS_c you found earlier.
SS_Trt=n∑_(i=1)^3(y (i.)- y (..)  )^2 


### Problem 4 (3.26/30)

Use software to do all the computations, and attach code and output at the end of the question.
If your answers rely on graphs, please include them along with the answer appropriately
Report p-value along with your conclusions
Data are given in Exercise3_26 Excel file .

Three brands of batteries are under study. It is suspected that the lives (in weeks) of the three brands are different. Five randomly selected batteries of each brand are tested with the following results:

```{r include=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
```
  (a) Are the lives of these brands of batteries different?
  (b) Analyze the residuals from this experiment.
  (c) Construct a 95 percent confidence interval estimate on the mean life of battery brand 2. Construct a 99 percent confidence interval estimate on the mean difference between the lives of battery brands 2 and 3.
  (d) Which brand would you select for use? If the manufacturer will replace without charge any battery that fails in less than 85 weeks, what percentage would the company expect to replace?
  
```{r echo=T}
table_battery <- read_xlsx("Exercise3_26.xlsx")
t.test(table_cellphone$TwentySeconds, table_cellphone$TenSeconds, paired = T,var.equal=T, alternative="greater", mu = 0, conf.level= 0.95)

```



```{r echo=T}

t.test(score~cool_down_time, data=gather(table_cellphone,key=cool_down_time,value=score), paired = T,var.equal=T, alternative="two.sided", mu = 0, conf.level= 0.95)

```

### Problem 5 (3.22/26)

The response time in milliseconds was determined for three different types of circuits that could be used in an
automatic valve shutoff mechanism. The results from a completely randomized experiment are shown in the following table:

```{r echo=T}
table_circuit <- read_xlsx("Exercise3_22.xlsx")
t.test(table_circuit$TwentySeconds, table_cellphone$TenSeconds, paired = T,var.equal=T, alternative="greater", mu = 0, conf.level= 0.95)

```

  (a) Test the hypothesis that the three circuit types have the same response time. Use 𝛼 = 0.01.
  (b) Use Tukey’s test to compare pairs of treatment means. Use 𝛼 = 0.01.
  (d) Construct a set of orthogonal contrasts, assuming that at the outset of the experiment you suspected the
response time of circuit type 2 to be different from the other two.
  (e) If you were the design engineer and you wished to minimize the response time, which circuit type would you select?
  (f) Analyze the residuals from this experiment. Are the basic analysis of variance assumptions satisfied?

### Problem 6: (3.41/9 and 3.49/57)

  (3.41/9) Refer to Problem 5. If we wish to detect a maximum difference in mean response times of 10 milliseconds with a probability of at least 0.90, what sample size should be used? How would you obtain a preliminary estimate of $σ^2$?

  (3.49/57) Consider the data shown in Problem 5.

  (a) Write out the least squares normal equations for this problem and solve them for 𝜇̂ and 𝜏̂i, using the usual constraint (3i=1 𝜏i = 0). Estimate 𝜏1− 𝜏2.
  (b) Solve the equations in (a) using the constraint ̂ 𝜏3 = 0. Are the estimators ̂ 𝜏i and 𝜇̂ the same as you found in (a)? Why? Now estimate 𝜏1 − 𝜏2 and compare your answer with that for (a). What statement can you make about estimating contrasts in the 𝜏i?
  (c) Estimate 𝜇 + 𝜏1, 2𝜏1 − 𝜏2 − 𝜏3, and 𝜇 + 𝜏1 + 𝜏2 using the two solutions to the normal equations. Compare the results obtained in each case.
