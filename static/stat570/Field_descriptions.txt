RKM_2008 - "River kilometer 2008" - The reach # that the river was divided into and the following fields summed at. Note that a few are missing.
"Habitat_area" - the total habitat area that was developed in a previous study. This is the variable we want to train a statistical model to estimate
"area_1m" - Area of the reach that is less than 1m deep
"area_2m" - Area of the reach that is less than 2m deep
"perc_1m" - Percent of reach that is less than 1m deep - unit: %
"perc_2m" - Percent of reach that is less than 2m deep" - unit: %
"MainChannel_area" - Total wetted area of primary channel (note - this is slightly different than what was used to calculate the percents above)
"SideChannel_area" - Total area of side channels along the reach - note that only some reaches have side channels
"Alcove_area" - Total area of alcoves along the reach - note that only some reaches have alcoves
"BareBar_area" - Total area of gravel bars along the reach
"VegetatedBar_area" - Total area of vegetated bars along the reach
"DisconnectedWater_area" - Total area of water that is present, but not connected to mainstem of the river
"InverseAlcove" - Total area of inverse acloves along the reach
"Bedrock_area" - Total area of reach that has exposed bedrock
"AllWetLength" - Total wetted length of all features (side channels, alcoves, etc.) along reach - units: meters
"AllWetArea" - Total wetted area of all features (side channels, alcoves, etc.) along reach
"MainChannelLength" - Total length of main channel along reach - unit: meters
"Slope" - Hydraulic slope of reach (m/m - unitless)
"Floodplain_elevation" - Indicator of how high floodplains are above channel

All units are m^2 unless otherwise noted.
