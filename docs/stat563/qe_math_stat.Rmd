Let $X_1,X_2,..,X_n$ be a random sample from $N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ distribution. Find a lower bound on the variance of any unbiased estimator of the 95th percentile of this distribution based on the Information Inequality. Also compare this bound to the variance of the uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator .

Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be two independent random variables each having uniform distribution
on the interval $(\theta,\theta+1)$. For testing $H_0:\theta=0$ against $H_a:\theta> 0$, we have two competing tests :

1. Test 1 : Reject $H_0 if X_1>0.95$

2. Test 2 : Reject $H_0 if X_1+X_2>c$.

Find the value of c so that the Test 2 has the same value of Type I error probability as Test 1.

$\alpha=P(x_1>0.95)=P(x_1+x_2>c)$

find pdf of $x_1+x_2$ (example of textbook)
