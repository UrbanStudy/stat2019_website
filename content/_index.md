### Core Requirements (33 credits):

Candidates must complete an approved 45-credit program, which includes at least 33 core credits in courses with the STAT prefix. These 33 credits must include courses distributed as follows:

 - Two 9-credit sequences:

~~STAT 561, 562, 563 Mathematical Statistics I, II, III~~ and

~~STAT 564, 565, 566 Applied Regression Analysis and Experimental Design~~

 - One 9-credit sequence chosen from

STAT 661, 662, 663 Advanced Mathematical Statistics I, II, III or

STAT 664, 665, 666 Theory of Linear Models I, II, III or

MTH 667, 668, 669 Stochastic Processes and Probability Theory I, II, III.

STAT 671, 672, 673 Statistical Learning I, II, III

STAT 570 Topics in Statistical Consulting, 3 credits (this course is currently offered during Spring term only)

3 credits of STAT 501, Statistical Literature and Problems.

### electives-12-credits

A total of 12 elective credit hours must be completed. The following list of courses is pre-approved for elective credit:

Stat 571 Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis

Stat 572 Bayesian Statistics

Stat 573 Computer Intensive Methods in Statistics

Stat 576 Sampling Theory and Methods

Stat 577 Categorical Data Analysis

Stat 578 Survival Analysis

Stat 580 Nonparametric Methods

Stat 661 Advanced Mathematical Statistics I

Stat 662 Advanced Mathematical Statistics II

Stat 663 Advanced Mathematical Statistics III

Stat 664 Theory of Linear Models I

Stat 665 Theory of Linear Models II

Stat 666 Theory of Linear Models III

Stat 567 Applied Probability I

Stat 568 Applied Probability II

Mth 667 Stochastic Processes and Probability Theory I

Mth 668 Stochastic Processes and Probability Theory II

Mth 669 Stochastic Processes and Probability Theory III

Stat 671 Statistical Learning I

Stat 672 Statistical Learning II

Stat 673 Statistical Learning III

CS 545 Machine Learning

Ec 572 Time Series Analysis and Forecasts

USP 655 Advanced Data Analysis: Structural Equation Modeling

Other statistically orientated courses outside the Department and other mathematics courses may be substituted, but must be approved as electives by the statistics graduate program advisor. &quot;Approved as elective&quot; means that it is approved inside the 12 elective credit hours but not inside the 33 statistical credit hour core requirements. A course or sequence cannot be counted both within the 33-hour core and as an elective course or sequence.

### MS Examinations:

Students must pass two examinations, one in Mathematical Statistics which covers STAT 561, 562, 563 and one in Applied Statistics which includes the core topics covered in STAT 564, 565, and 566. Examinations are scheduled twice per year, the week before the Fall term and during the first week of Spring term. Students may take any examination at most two times. Students must be registered for and complete at least one graduate credit during the term in which they take an exam. See the MS examination policy for more detailed information.

### Applied Statistics

The Applied Statistics Exam is comprised of two components:

 - Applied regression analysis

 - Design of experiments and ANOVA

Both components consist of a written exam portion and a separate, in-laboratory, statistical computing applications portion. The Applied Statistics Exam may be repeated once; that is, a maximum of two tries is permitted.

A Pass (P) or Fail (F) is given on each component.

Two P's equal a PASS on the exam.

One P equals a CONDITIONAL PASS on the exam. The Examination Committee will inform the student of the requirements for removal of the Conditional. Two F's equal a FAIL on the exam. In this case the entire exam must be retaken.

 - Topics:
 
**Regression:** Simple linear regression, model assumptions, diagnostics, and inference; matrix approach to regression; multiple regression, model assumptions, diagnostics and inference; indicator variables; interaction; stepwise and other model building procedures, Box-Cox transformation on the response.

**Experimental Design:** Introduction to analysis of variance, single factor design, model assumptions and diagnostics, multiple comparisons of means, contrasts, test for equal variance, Latin and Graeco-Latin squares, randomized block designs, balanced incomplete designs; factorial designs including 2k and 3k and fractional factorials with confounding; fixed and random effects and expected mean squares; nested and crossed effects; randomization restrictions; analysis of covariance, connection to regression models; response surfaces; rank-based methods.

 - Computing portion of examination:
 
In addition to the above written examination, there will be a THREE-hour computer or laboratory based examination where a data set will be provided and students will be asked to use appropriate software to do the data analysis necessary to answer questions posed. Data set(s) will be selected from among regression and experimental design.
